# This file should contain all the record creation needed to seed the database with its default values.
# The data can then be loaded with the rails db:seed command (or created alongside the database with db:setup).
#
# Examples:

Cocktail.create(name: "lemon cocktail")
Cocktail.create(name: "ice cocktail")
Cocktail.create(name: "mint leaves cocktail")
